# Intro
this implementation of trigram distance takes inspiration mainly from the way PostgreSQL allows search via pg_trgm.

i have never read the actual code, but still i thought it could have been a good idea to learn such a simple fuzzy string matching algorithm

# How it works
Definitions:

Query/Keyword
the thing we are searching for, it generates an array of trigrams deleting duplicates

Text
the thing that you search for, the text is allowed to have duplicate trigrams in his generated array

Steps:
1. generate arrays of both query and text
2. count occurences of trigrams from query into text and sum them up
3. Divide the amount of matches by the amount of total trigrams for text

__Note:__ the trigrams generated by my implementation are all just shifted by one instead of shifting them by 3, this in fact works better for our fuzzy search thing, we also normalize them a bit by lowercasing, removing spaces and we pad the sides with spaces to give more importance to the end and beginning pieces, i strongly advise you to also normalize accents and special characters etc. depending on the language(for example ß to ss or ì to i)

# Notable defects
the algorithm is pretty sensitive to string length, also is not that good at sequential matching since it's a fuzzy string matching algorithm by nature

to fix this you may run a shorter ngram (min 2 chars still) on shorter strings and eventually weight it with sequential matching if needed, remember to always adjust the bias every time you tweak the algorithm, a good bias i found when implementing my solution with the very similar pg_trgm was 0.3 as the bottom line, 0.3 is good for plain trigram string matching

if you want to do your homeworks [this medium article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220817083706/https://medium.com/tim-black/fuzzy-string-matching-at-scale-41ae6ac452c2) has a section about benchmarking this type of algorithm using two different film titles database with slightly different film titles
